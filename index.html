          <h2>The Wrens - "Meadowlands"</h2>
          <p>
            "The Wrens' third album, The Meadowlands, is a sprawling, shifting affair,
            perhaps reflecting the fact that it took four years to create. It's easy to
            take the sweet, slightly alt-country "13 Months in 6 Minutes" at face value
            -- the song's epic feel suggests the passing of a considerable chunk of time,
            and at the Wrens' pace, it's possible that it did take over a year to craft.
            Rather fittingly, the album itself is also long, and the way that its songs
            jump and shift in tone and mood suggests a series of journal entries strung
            together, connected loosely by an overall brokenhearted feeling. A pair of
            bitterly pretty songs open The Meadowlands after the interlude "The House
            That Guilt Built" sets the tone with its early summer evening atmosphere: on
            "Happy," the Wrens sing "Are you happy?/You got what you want/I'm over it
            now," revealing their true feelings before shimmering guitars carry the song
            off on another tangent; "She Sends Kisses" goes from whispery, late-night
            anguish to high drama. Like Secaucus, most of the album trades in a classic
            indie rock sound -- just this side of accessible, but not overly experimental
            either. "This Boy Is Exhausted" and the new wavey "Faster Gun" are deceptively
            simple, bright, and shiny but with underlying complexities that provide a
            sharp contrast to the album's gentler moments, such as the shambling beauty of
            "Thirteen Grand" and the sweetly twangy "Ex-Girl Collection." The Meadowlands
            saves some of its most rock moments for the end of the album: "Per Second
            Second," an angular, Pixies-esque bit of punk, and the anthemic "Everyone
            Chooses Sides" send the album out in a blaze of glory that initially seems
            a little at odds with the melancholy tone of the rest of the album but, after
            a few listens, reveals itself as strangely appropriate. It's possible that
            The Meadowlands might be a "better" album if it were more focused and logical,
            but there's something to be said for its immersive, stream-of-consciousness
            approach. It's also tempting to say that hopefully it won't take the Wrens
            as long to make their next album as it did to make The Meadowlands, but when
            the results are this good, the time it took to make the album is more than
            justified." - AllMusic.com

          <h2>At The Drive-In - "Relationship Of Command"</h2>
          <p>
            "Welcome to the breath-robbing, heart-pounding Relationship of Command, an
            album many have been waiting for with red-faced anticipation since their
            last EP, the brilliant Vaya. On this 11-track masterpiece, so full of
            adrenaline and swarming moods, ATDI has created one of the most infecting
            and mind-blowing rock albums in a long time. While most of the tracks are
            of the more aggressive edge, this is undeniably the band's most focused
            and well put together and, therefore, best all-around album yet. "Quarantined"
            and "Sleepwalk Capsules" alone make this album worth purchasing: This music
            is seamless and inspiring. Electronic movements meshed into "Enfilade" stretch
            the texture of the album further, into the unique backup vocals of Iggy Pop
            on "Rolodex Propaganda." Amidst all the rock, there is the undeniably unique
            edge about ATDI's sound, something that has permeated through their music
            from the Hell Paso 7". Beautiful vocals bursting passion in quirky, abstract,
            and often thrilling lyrics, youthful energy, driving melodies, and a sense of
            beyond-the-moment urgency. Moving from Relentless to Grand Royal, as well as
            to the notorious and mostly infamous producer Ross Robinson, has not killed the
            band's spirit or sound, as many loyal fans feared it would in the pattern of
            Jawbreaker, Jawbox, among others. If anything, it has allowed the band to push
            themselves to new limits, to fulfill what they have been working for relentlessly
            for so long. This is not a band that could ever be insincere. You can see it in
            their eyes and feel it in their music and work ethic. ATDI is one of the saviors
            of true emotional straight-up rock!" - AllMusic.com

          <h2>The Beatles - Revolver</h2>
          <p>
            "All the rules fell by the wayside with Revolver, as the Beatles began
            exploring new sonic territory, lyrical subjects, and styles of composition.
            It wasn't just Lennon and McCartney, either -- Harrison staked out his
            own dark territory with the tightly wound, cynical rocker "Taxman"; the
            jaunty yet dissonant "I Want to Tell You"; and "Love You To," George's
            first and best foray into Indian music. Such explorations were bold, yet
            they were eclipsed by Lennon's trippy kaleidoscopes of sound. His most
            straightforward number was "Doctor Robert," an ode to his dealer, and
            things just got stranger from there as he buried "And Your Bird Can Sing"
            in a maze of multi-tracked guitars, gave Ringo a charmingly hallucinogenic
            slice of childhood whimsy in "Yellow Submarine," and then capped it off
            with a triptych of bad trips: the spiraling "She Said She Said"; the
            crawling, druggy "I'm Only Sleeping"; and "Tomorrow Never Knows," a pure
            nightmare where John sang portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead into
            a suspended microphone over Ringo's thundering, menacing drumbeats and
            layers of overdubbed, phased guitars and tape loops. McCartney's experiments
            were formal, as he tried on every pop style from chamber pop to soul,
            and when placed alongside Lennon's and Harrison's outright experimentations,
            McCartney's songcraft becomes all the more impressive. The biggest
            miracle of Revolver may be that the Beatles covered so much new stylistic
            ground and executed it perfectly on one record, or it may be that all of
            it holds together perfectly. Either way, its daring sonic adventures and
            consistently stunning songcraft set the standard for what pop/rock could
            achieve. Even after Sgt. Pepper, Revolver stands as the ultimate modern
            pop album and it's still as emulated as it was upon its original release."
